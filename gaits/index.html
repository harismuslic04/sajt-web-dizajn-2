        <h1><strong>The five Gaits of the Icelandic horse.</strong></h1>
        <p>
          The Icelandic horse is what is called a gaited breed, they have,
          unlike other breeds five gaits. Tölt and Flying pace are the gaits who
          make the Icelandic horse very special and desirable to ride. The
          horses of Iceland are a so-called gaited horse breed. This means that
          most Icelandic horses have two extra gaits to offer besides walk, trot
          and canter/gallop. All horse breeds have these three natural gaits and
          can perform them without training. The extra gaits that set the
          Icelandic horse apart from other breeds are called tölt and flying
          pace.
        </p>
        <h1>Walk,Trot and Gallop</h1>
        <p id="drugi">
          The walk is one of the horse’s natural gaits. It is a slow, four-beat,
          symmetry gait where there are either one or two legs touching the
          ground. The legs touch the ground longer than they glide in the air.
          <br /><br />
          The trot is a natural two-beat gait where the horses move two legs
          diagonally to each other. This gait is faster than the walk and is
          often used first when the horses are being trained. This gait is more
          rough and bouncy than Tölt but it is important to allow the horses to
          trot since they use this gait to rest, especially on rough terrain and
          when going uphills.
          <br /><br />
          Gallop is a three-beat natural gait where the horse glides a bit in
          the air. The horses can gallop at a different speed from slow to fast
          gallop. On the Icelandic horse, the gallop and canter are considered
          to be one combined gait.

        <p id="drugi">
          Tölt is the four-beat lateral gait, that the breed is best known for.
          The horse’s hind legs should move well under the body and carry more
          of the weight than the front end, allowing the front to rise and be
          free and loose. Tölt is very smooth to ride since there is no
          suspension between strides, as is the case in trot or canter. Tölt can
          be ridden very slowly and up to a very fast speed, depending on the
          horse and its training level.

          Flying pace is often called the "fifth gear" and is a two-beat lateral
          gait with suspension. Flying pace is ridden very fast and over short
          distances. It is sometimes used for racing over 100 to 250 meters. Not
          all Icelandic horses can pace but those that do are often considered
          the best of the breed.
