        <h1>ELEGANT AND POWERFUL</h1>
        <p>
          The Icelandic horse has been bred selectively for a long time, which
          has improved the breed, especially over the last few decades. The
          official breeding goal of Icelandic horses is to produce a healthy,
          fertile, and durable riding horse, a robust and yet elegant and
          versatile horse with five excellent gaits. The conformation should
          offer optimal natural balance, and the movements should be supple,
          high and ground covering in all gaits, giving an elegant and powerful
          image. <br /><br />
          Horses are usually started under saddle at three-and-a-half years old
          in the fall and given a break for one to two months before training
          starts again in December. Then, they are prepared for breeding
          evaluation shows in the spring, which start in May. In Iceland, horses
          are evaluated from four years of age. All breeding evaluations are
          registered in WorldFengur . <br /><br />
          When a horse is evaluated, a group of breeding judges (usually three)
          assesses the horse’s conformation from the ground, giving marks for
          the different traits, and then watches the horse in action on a
          straight track, to evaluate the horse's riding abilities. Apart from
          the spring shows, breeding evaluations are organised in July during
          shows often called midsummer shows or during Landsmót every other
          year. Late summer shows are also scheduled in August. At the World
          Championships every other year, opposite Landsmót, horses with the
          best breeding scores from all FEIF countries are re-evaluated and
          rewarded.

        <h1>Size</h1>
        <p>
          The size of Icelandic horses can vary considerably, from just about
          130 cm on highest point of withers, to over 150 cm. The average size
          of horses shown in breeding evaluation is now at 142 cm to the withers
          which is considerably taller than 30 years ago. The reason for horses
          growing taller is due partly to better feed, but also selective
          breeding.
        </p>
        <h1>Coroulful characters</h1>
        <p>
          The official breeding goal is to preserve all possible varieties of
          coat colour within the breed. It still should be kept in mind that
          some colour variations are correlated with genetic or physical defects
          that should be avoided. <br /><br />
          The horse’s character should enable it to be used for different roles.
          It should be calm, friendly and cooperative, as well as courageous and
          reliable. The breeding goal encompasses everything from sensitive and
          willing horses to calmer types, but always with an emphasis on
          willingness to perform.

        <h1 id="h13">The true icelandic Gæðingur</h1>
        <p id="pp">
          The conformation should be functional and promote the health and
          durability of the horse where carrying ability, natural gaiting
          ability and the capacity to move under a rider in balance and correct
          body function are paramount. The conformation should also be
          characterized by beauty and attractive appearance with an emphasis on
          strength and muscularity. <br /><br />
          The aim is to breed a quality gaited horse that has a natural ability
          to carry a rider in balance, self-carriage and is beautiful when
          ridden, a horse that is agile, sure-footed and with good stamina – a
          true Icelandic gæðingur. The main goal with regards to the gaiting
          ability is that the gaits have correct beat and body function, the
          horse is moving freely in an even rhythm. The gaits should moreover
          possess suppleness, lightness, long strides and speed capacity. Read
