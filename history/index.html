      They were brought to Iceland long before any of the European Breeds that

      have to the first domesticated horses. The Norse horses that first
      arrived in Iceland with the Vikings were compact, sturdy animals,
      slightly larger than today’s Icelandic Horses. The horse had helped the
      Norse people to succeed and prosper by allowing them to travel long
      distances, carry heavy loads, and plow their fields, at a time when most
      Europeans were still plowing their fields by hand. The Vikings
      recognized the value and political power of their horses and gave them a
      place of great honor in their history and culture. They took them every
      where they went. So, when the first Vikings set sail to explore Northern
      oceans, along with them went the strong little horses."
        data-sr="Islandski konji su jedna od najstarijih rasa konja na svetu. Doneti su na Island mnogo pre nego što su evropske rase koje nam danas dobro poznate bile uspostavljene. Islandski konj, zajedno sa samo nekoliko drugih retkih rasa, predstavlja najbližu povezanost koju imamo sa prvim domestikovanim konjima. Norveški konji koji su prvi stigli na Island sa Vikingima bili su kompaktni, čvrsti životinje, malo veći od današnjih islandskih konja. Konj je pomogao Norvežanima da uspeju i napreduju omogućavajući im da putuju na velike udaljenosti, nose teške terete i ore njihova polja, u vreme kada su većina Evropljana još uvek orali svoja polja ručno. Vikinzi su prepoznali vrednost i političku moć svojih konja i dali im mesto velikog časti u svojoj istoriji i kulturi. Nosili su ih svuda gde su išli. Tako su, kada su prvi Vikinzi krenuli da istražuju severne okeane, sa njima išli i ti jaki mali konji."

        data-en=" The domesticated horses in Europe at the time were born gaited, meaning
      they had four and five gaits. The nomadic people who first domesticated
      them encouraged both pacing and other flying gaits which could carry
      them long distances without tiring the horses. So, the horses that came
      to Iceland were excellent riding horses as well as being capable of hard
      work. Iceland is not an easy place to make home. There are no trees
      (actually, these days there are a few). The island is volcanic so,
      although it provides an unusual abundance of life for it’s northern
      latitude. The ground is a mass of large grassy hummocks overlaying rock,
      and does not turn easily into farmland. It is certainly not an ideal
      setting for the horse. Both horse and people have had to face cold and
      starvation on more than one occasion in Iceland. As a result, horses and
      people have become specialized in Icelandic living over the years. The
      Vikings also used a good number of horse for food, this they still do.
      The horses that were not top quality were used to supplement their diets
      since red meat was, and still is, scarce in Iceland."
        data-sr="Domestikovani konji u Evropi tog vremena su rođeni sa specifičnim hodovima, što znači da su imali četiri i pet hodova. Nomadski ljudi koji su ih prvi domestikovali podsticali su kako hodanje tako i druge leteće hodove koji su im omogućavali da prelaze velike udaljenosti bez umaranja konja. Tako su konji koji su stigli na Island bili izvanredni jahački konji, kao i sposobni za težak rad. Island nije lako mesto za život. Nema mnogo drveća (zapravo, danas ih ima malo). Ostrvo je vulkansko, pa, iako pruža neuobičajeno bogatstvo života za svoju severnu geografski širinu, tlo je masa velikih travnatih uzvišenja preko stene i teško se pretvara u obradivo zemljište. Sigurno nije idealno okruženje za konja. I konj i ljudi su morali da se suoče sa hladnoćom i glađu više od jednom na Islandu. Kao rezultat toga, konji i ljudi su tokom godina postali specijalizovani za život na Islandu. Vikinzi su takođe koristili veliki broj konja za hranu, što i dalje rade. Konji koji nisu bili vrhunskog kvaliteta korišćeni su za dopunu njihove ishrane, budući da je crveno meso bilo, i još uvek je, oskudno na Islandu."

      Icelandic Horses have never been cross-bred with other horses. They have
      remained pure for over a thousand years. Icelandic people are very proud

      willing. Their unique gaits make them a joy to ride, and they appear to

        data-sr="Kada su Evropljani počeli masovno da umiru od kuge, Island je uveo karantin. Dugi niz godina, ništa i niko nije dolazio na Island. Čak i danas je protok živih životinja i biljaka zabranjen ili strogo ograničen. Jedan od rezultata ovog karantina je što se islandski konji nikada nisu ukrštali sa drugim konjima. Ostali su čisti više od hiljadu godina. Islanđani su veoma ponosni na svoje konje, a islandski konji zapravo deluju veoma ponosno na sebe. Teškoće koje su preživeli omogućile su im da budu konji koji se ne boje da se suoče sa svetom. Oni su prijateljski nastrojeni, stabilni, jaki i voljni. Njihovi jedinstveni hodovi čine jahanje uživanjem, a čini se da oni sami uživaju u tom iskustvu koliko i mi! Preporučujem svima koji vole konje da jašu islandskog konja. Nikada više nećete gledati konje na isti način."
