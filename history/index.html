        Icelandic Horses are one of the oldest breeds of horse in the world.
        They were brought to Iceland long before any of the European Breeds that
        we are so familiar with had been established. The Icelandic Horse, along
        with only a couple of other rare breeds, represent the closest link we
        have to the first domesticated horses. The Norse horses that first
        arrived in Iceland with the Vikings were compact, sturdy animals,
        slightly larger than today’s Icelandic Horses. The horse had helped the
        Norse people to succeed and prosper by allowing them to travel long
        distances, carry heavy loads, and plow their fields, at a time when most
        Europeans were still plowing their fields by hand. The Vikings
        recognized the value and political power of their horses and gave them a
        place of great honor in their history and culture. They took them every
        where they went. So, when the first Vikings set sail to explore Northern
        oceans, along with them went the strong little horses.

        The domesticated horses in Europe at the time were born gaited, meaning
        they had four and five gaits. The nomadic people who first domesticated
        them encouraged both pacing and other flying gaits which could carry
        them long distances without tiring the horses. So, the horses that came
        to Iceland were excellent riding horses as well as being capable of hard
        work. Iceland is not an easy place to make home. There are no trees
        (actually, these days there are a few). The island is volcanic so,
        although it provides an unusual abundance of life for it’s northern
        latitude. The ground is a mass of large grassy hummocks overlaying rock,
        and does not turn easily into farmland. It is certainly not an ideal
        setting for the horse. Both horse and people have had to face cold and
        starvation on more than one occasion in Iceland. As a result, horses and
        people have become specialized in Icelandic living over the years. The
        Vikings also used a good number of horse for food, this they still do.
        The horses that were not top quality were used to supplement their diets
        since red meat was, and still is, scarce in Iceland.

        When Europeans started dying in mass numbers from the plague, Iceland
        quarantined itself. For many years, nothing and no one came to Iceland.
        Even today the flow of live animals and plants is forbidden or strictly
        restricted. One of the results of this quarantine has been that
        Icelandic Horses have never been cross-bred with other horses. They have
        remained pure for over a thousand years. Icelandic people are very proud
        of their horses and Icelandic horses in fact, seem very proud of
        themselves. The hardships they survived have given a horse that is not
        afraid to face the world. They are friendly. sure footed, strong, and
        willing. Their unique gaits make them a joy to ride, and they appear to
        enjoy the experience as much as we do ! I encourage any and all who love
        horses to ride an Icelandic. You will never look at horses in quite the
        same way again.
